WHAT THIS MOD HAS IN DETAIL
========================
>	A full week with new character(s) including 3 original songs and 1 remix of the Tutorial
>	A background for each song based on the Week's story, including one for Tutorial-Remix
>	Cross Fade system in songs that allows after images to show  during certain parts of the song (usually the really fast raps or after the beatdrop hits different)
>	Animated cutscenes for songs on story mode with dialogue(which are skippable using the SPACE button)
>	Dialogue box system featuring different emotions for each character portrait and a stylish font (dialogue boxes are assets from the original game)
>	FreePlay Menu camera bumps to the songs BPM to give a groovy and dancehouse effect
>	ALT Mode difficulty features song charts that are more difficult and have diverse patterns (originally experimental charts)
>	Replay option in Story Mode for cutscenes in case you missed them (or you just want a fancy way to restart)
>	Death Counter that shows how many times Sarvente sent you and your fingers to heaven
>	There is a secret part in story mode which you will find out eventually if you manage to defeat the songs.

v1.3.26.21 UPDATE:
------------------
> Implemented the Sarv Engine, which allows accuracy and ease in pressing notes for FNF, and also allows high bounds for late and early notes
	> Includes tracking of Misses, Accuracy(toggled), Rating and Deaths
	> Allows changing of control scheme to WASD,DFJK,QWOP and IJKL. All include the directions to work as well
	> Implements slowing down of what used to be 'echo notes'which means all notes too close to each other excluding doubles will slow down when the note before it is hit
	> Color coded ratings
	> Contains pattern support where patterns that a hit are read faster with less lag than normal
> Updated Sarv's sprite sheets to allow smoother animations for Idle animation and fixed the sliding bug
> Fixed the dialogue spam bug and typos
> Fixed the boyfriend's crossfade bug (slightly, which has been reduced to one crossfade)
> Recharted all the charts for Week + of all difficulties

EXTRA NOTES
====================
>	Song charts JSON files in this mod may not be reusuable in other mods or the original game as they will CRASH the game since they are not compatitible. They have been tweaked a little to allow crossFades to appear in gameplay at certain times and they are parsible only in the Charter of this mod (which can parse normal song charts too but will save them as a modified chart).
	>	If you do want to make charts using this charter, note those charts you made here will only work in THIS mod, please use the original game if you do not wish to make a song with cross fades!!
>	I understand file digging, but unless you're a moderator or you're a helping dev, it's not really good to check for the files until you've actually played the mod (there is a lot in it??)

>	I hope you have fun and thank you for downloading!! Much appreciated!!
