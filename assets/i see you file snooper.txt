Note that some of the song chart JSON Files for this mod differ slightly from the ones in the original, especially the alt mode charts.
So if you attempt to use of these charts in another mod or the original game, IT WILL CRASH!!!!

Check for the JSON Files that have song-name1.json instead of song-name.json (anything with a 1 after the songs name),
since these have no data for crossfades and work well like a normal JSON file for song charts. I partially also did this for preventing
cheating on certain songs using bots, but I do understand if you wish to use a bot for any of these charts, I prefer you use them
without the crossfades!!
